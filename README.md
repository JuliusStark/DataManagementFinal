This tool assists with the evaluation of gel electrophoresis images.

The workflow is as follows:
- Run the program.
- The program will then ask for the image path.
- It then asks for metadata about the circumstances in which the image was created. This information is entered by the user via the command line. Some known BP values of the ladder must also be provided.
- The program will then prompt you to set the frame for the calculation using your pointer.
- To do this, first click on a pocket, then click on the bottom edge of the image. Next, you must specify an estimated value in pixels for the width of a lane and the number of lanes displayed.

The following image shows the location of the ladder within the image. This information must also be entered into the program in the next steps.

- The ladder bands are now displayed, and the user checks their position, as well as ensuring that the selected bands correspond to the specified band values.
- Finally, the same procedure is carried out with the other sample lanes, after which a final graphic is produced containing a tabular list of the bands, the marked image and a calibration curve.

All data is then saved in .json and .csv files.
The image is also saved.
